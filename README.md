# Bonfire: A 3D Action RPG

**Bonfire** is a 3D Action RPG inspired by the Soulslike genre, designed to showcase my ability to develop intricate gameplay mechanics and features for video games. This project represents my technical and creative skills in game development, making it an essential part of my portfolio.

## Key Features

### Immersive Theme
Bonfire invites players into an open world with a tranquil atmosphere, offering a unique blend of exploration and action. The narrative is light-hearted, featuring a humorous plot that stems from an inside joke among my university friends. (Yes, you may encounter a giant, breakdancing turtle doing push-ups!)

### Core Gameplay Mechanics
The gameplay is deeply inspired by the Soulslike genre, emphasizing strategic combat and resource management:
- **Stamina System:** Player actions are governed by a stamina bar, ensuring that every move counts.
- **Combat & Progression:** Defeat enemies to earn experience points (EXP), which can be used at shrines to enhance player stats. Resting at shrines also heals the player, but non-boss enemies will respawn.

### Procedural Game World
The game world is procedurally generated using a custom Landscape Generator Tool that I developed. Although the parameters are fixed, resulting in a consistent environment for each playthrough, this highlights my capability in procedural generation and tool development.


### Custom Assets & Technical Artistry
While the models and textures used are third-party assets, I created the VFX, shaders, and composed the music. This demonstrates my proficiency in technical artistry and my ability to enhance the gameâ€™s visual and auditory experience.

## Additional Notes

- **NPC Interactions:** In line with Soulslike game conventions, players need to interact with NPCs multiple times to unlock their full dialogue. This design choice reflects my attention to genre-specific details and player expectations.
