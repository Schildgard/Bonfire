# About

Bonfire is a 3D-Action RPG inspired by the Soulslike genre. Its purpose is to showcase my proficency to code general features and complex mechanics for Videogames.

### Theme
The game features an open landscape, a mellow atmosphere and and a small plot which, to be fair was basically an inside joke between my friends at university and me (just in case you wonder why you encounter a giant, breakdancing turtle doing push ups).

### Gameplay Mechanics
The Gameplay is inspired by standards of the Soulslike genre. That includes a stamina bar and animations limiting the players actions.  
Defeating enemies grants exp which can be used at a shrine to increse player stats, while resting also heals the player but respawns non-boss-enemies. NPCs have to be talked to multiple times for their full dialogue.
